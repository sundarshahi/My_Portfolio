# Jonathan Pan's Portfolio

[Deployed Here](https://www.jonmpan.com)

Welcome to the github repo for my portfolio. You can copy this repo and use it for yourself if you so incline. Built with create-react-app and some boilerplate server/express code. Currently the backend serves my BixbyDex API. Styled with Materialize. Deployed on heroku. Testing.
